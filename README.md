# TimeSeries

The creation of the functioning of the segmentation of timeseries as a tool of handling them The segmentation focuses on the division of the timeseries to proper inner homogeneous segments so that the structure of the timeseries is found out through the discovery of patterns or even rules based on the conduct of the observed variable. More specifically, our system accepts as input data files in .csv, .tsv and .xlsx form which are depicted subsequently the graphical environment we have created. Then, the algorithm of the segmentation is applied in order for us to present to our graphical environment the segmented timeseries. I use two algorithms for the segmentation Top-down and Bottom-Up algorithm. At the end of this process, we have the information that researchers or analysts need to study such data and discover patterns or rules. Our code is written in Java language and our graphical environment was created with JavaFx.
